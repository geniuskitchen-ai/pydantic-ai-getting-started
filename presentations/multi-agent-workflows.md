## Multi-Agent Workflows

---

### Disclaimer

Most LLM apps do not have to be repurposed or created as Agents. Even when you do (if you have the need to use more than 5 tools or functions), the majority of multi-agent examples don’t require a graph or state machine. 

As a matter of fact, implementing them this way would make the code more complex and harder to understand. 

---

### How to Proceed

You should only consider using this functionality if:
* You have a solid understanding of using Agents with tools and function calling.
* You have already explored standard programming techniques to connect agents.
* Even after that, you’re confident that a graph library and state machine are necessary.

* Introducing state machines and graphs with nodes of agents introduce a lot of complexity and requires advanced engineering skills to design, develop and maintain.
